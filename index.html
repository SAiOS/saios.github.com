            <p>Please join us for free food and drinks at Geekdom. This months presentation is by Laurel Bean (@delphynelaurel) on "Beginning Core Data."   Robust iOS applications need to manage their own data and Core Data makes this easier. This session describes what the Core Data framework does, how to use it, and examples of implementation.</p>
